Hey there, 

One of your friends anonymously wanted to let you know that you send WAY too many emails.

And you know... that's not great...

Being that guy is rarely a good thing, so here are 3 things you can do:

1. Tag another friend that sends too many emails to pass the blame and ease your conscience at http://minimize.email

2. Consider Twist or Basecamp for deeper, calmer, and more meaningful work. 

3. If you absolutely must write an email, write a process-centric one -> http://calnewport.com/blog/2016/04/19/write-longer-emails/

Be well and don't forget to tag a colleague! -> http://minimize.email 👋
